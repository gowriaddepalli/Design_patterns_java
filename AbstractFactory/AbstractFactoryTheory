ABSTRACT FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN:

+ Abstract Factory design pattern is one of the Creational pattern. 
+ Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern except the fact that its more like factory of factories.
+ This factory class returns different subclasses based on the input provided and factory class uses if-else or switch statement to achieve this.
+ In Abstract Factory pattern, we get rid of if-else block and have a factory class for each sub-class. 
+ Then an Abstract Factory class that will return the sub-class based on the input factory class.
+ Abstract Factory design pattern provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation.
+ Abstract Factory pattern is “factory of factories” and can be easily extended to accommodate more products.
+ Abstract Factory pattern is robust and avoid conditional logic of Factory pattern.
